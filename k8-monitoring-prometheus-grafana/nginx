Run the Nginx Prometheus Exporter: You would typically run the nginx-prometheus-exporter container alongside your Nginx container or on a separate pod.

docker run -d -p 9113:9113 --name nginx-prometheus-exporter \
  -e NGINX_STATUS_URL=http://nginx:8080/nginx_status \
  quay.io/prometheus/nginx-prometheus-exporter

The exporter fetches the data from http://nginx:8080/nginx_status and exposes it at http://<nginx_exporter_host>:9113/metrics

In your Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml), you would set up a scrape configuration for the Nginx exporter:
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'nginx'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['nginx-exporter:9113']
      This tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from the nginx-exporter at the /metrics endpoint.



Key Differences:
Nginx:

Nginx doesn't expose Prometheus metrics natively.
You need to use an exporter to expose metrics in the Prometheus format.
Prometheus scrapes the exporter at /metrics.
Custom Applications (Node.js, Python):

Applications expose metrics at /metrics natively (using libraries like prom-client or prometheus_client).
Prometheus scrapes the app directly at /metrics.

How the Nginx Exporter Works
The Nginx Prometheus exporter does the following:

Scrapes Nginx's internal stats: It connects to Nginxâ€™s stub_status endpoint, which exposes basic metrics like active connections, requests handled, etc. You need to configure Nginx to expose this data.

Converts the data into Prometheus format: The exporter takes the data from Nginx and formats it into a time-series data format that Prometheus can scrape and store.

Exposes a /metrics endpoint: The exporter runs as an HTTP server that exposes metrics at /metrics. This is where Prometheus will scrape the data.

Flow of Metrics Scraping
Nginx Prometheus Exporter connects to the stub_status page (/nginx_status) exposed by Nginx to collect the metrics.
The exporter then exposes these metrics at the /metrics endpoint in a Prometheus-compatible format.
Prometheus scrapes the /metrics endpoint of the exporter (e.g., nginx-exporter:9113/metrics) at the specified scrape interval and stores the metrics as time series data.
